MTGInator
==========================

This is a package for simulating (or goldfishing) Magic: The Gathering decks against each other, and optimizing manabases
For Manabases - the basic principle I am following is:
    "The optimal manabase is one that, on average, allows you to cast the most spells in the most mana-efficient manner".


Magic: The Gathering is a wholly owned trademark of Hasbro, Inc.
